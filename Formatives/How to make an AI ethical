# How to make AI ethical


To make my AI ethical i would look into Four catgroies:

1. Fairness: To make My AI fair, i would first merge unique datasets into one  to make the bot as unbiased as possible, and then in the scereen i would tell the user to look at a link containing a video to educate the user into seeing that if prompted, it would give a diffrent resualts to acomadate for curcumstances. 
2. Accountibblity: To make my AI accountble, it would be prompted that it was wrong and then be accountble.
3. Transperancy: If prompeted, the AI would elobrate on how it got its soloutions, if prompeted more, it would break down spefic steps futher. 
4. Privicy: instead of promising that your data is safe, it would not collect your data by just not asking for it. the only data the bot would posses is ehat would be typed in the text box.
