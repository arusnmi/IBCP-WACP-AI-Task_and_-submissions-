Introduction:
The metaverse represents the transition of humans into the digital world. It is the next step in the evolution of the internet, where people can connect online to play games, socialise, and even shop. The metaverse seeks to integrate our everyday lives into the digital world, allowing activities we do in real life to be incorporated into virtual environments. To better understand the metaverse, we must first understand the different stages of the internet.
The first iteration, known as Web 1.0, was the era of static websites where users could only view information without any interaction—essentially a "read-only" experience.
The second iteration, Web 2.0, enabled users to interact with and contribute to websites, making it a "read and write" era. This phase marked the beginning of the real world blending with the digital world. Popular platforms like Amazon, YouTube, and others emerged, and search engines such as Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo made web access easier for the average person.
Components:
Several key components make up the metaverse, each of which could play a significant role in the future. One important component is artificial intelligence (AI), which enables the creation of artificial humans—virtual entities that can think and interact like us but aren't real. Another application of AI is in the creation of virtual people, computer-generated humans that appear lifelike but don't exist in reality. AI gives these entities a voice and thoughts.(Giusto)
Extended Reality (XR) is another fundamental component, an umbrella term for Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). VR involves building a fully immersive virtual world around the user using specialised lenses that project a 3D environment. AR allows digital elements to be projected into the real world, enhancing it. MR blends both real and virtual elements, allowing users to interact with both simultaneously.
Another key element of the metaverse is Web 3.0 technology. Web 3.0 is a decentralised web, where control is distributed among users instead of being held by centralised authorities. This enables new ways of shopping and conducting transactions in the metaverse.(ethrum )
Real-World Examples:
To illustrate the components of Web 3.0, we can look at real-world examples. For AI, there are videos created entirely by artificial intelligence without human involvement. These videos can also represent virtual people, as the speaker in such videos doesn’t exist in real life.(Giusto)
For XR components, the Oculus 3 headset is a good example of VR, as it projects a virtual world around the user. The measurement tool on the Apple iPhone serves as an example of AR by projecting a line onto real-world objects for accurate measurements. The Apple Vision Pro uses cameras to merge digital elements with the physical world, exemplifying MR.
The best example of Web 3.0 technology is cryptocurrency, a decentralised currency managed through blockchain technology.(ethrum )
Benefits and Drawbacks:
One of the primary benefits of the metaverse is its ability to facilitate communication and interaction without the need for physical proximity. This is particularly useful for people who are geographically distant and cannot meet in person.(Giusto)
The main advantage of virtual people is that they can provide human-like interactions for those who may be feeling lonely, even if no physical human is present.
Cryptocurrency’s primary benefit is that it is trustless. In this context, "trustless" doesn’t mean it lacks trust; rather, it means there is no need for a central system that requires trust.(ethrum )
However, these systems also have drawbacks. A potential issue with the metaverse is that people might neglect the real world, leading to negative consequences such as poor physical health or even cybercrime that could affect users in real life.
The main drawback of virtual people is that if they are programmed with harmful behaviours, they could potentially cause harm in the virtual world.(Giusto)
With XR, people may use the technology to escape their real-world problems, which can be unhealthy.
A significant risk with cryptocurrency is its volatility; one day, its value could drop to nothing, rendering it useless.(ethrum )
Ethics:
The main ethical concern surrounding the metaverse is the potential neglect of the real world. If we abandon our physical world and its problems, it could deteriorate. However, the metaverse also has the potential to improve people's lives, providing solutions for previously incurable conditions and enabling stronger human connections. The ethics of AI also comes into play here because the AI would only store the information that is given to it by the creator  of that AI, so the beliefs of the creator could be projected in the AI, and it could have bias towards certain topics. Another ethical consideration is the possibility that  certain companies could promote false advertising inside the AI. This could lead to the environment being a business that is corrupted by money, and fame. Ethics also falls under cryptocurrency as the association that is behind the cryptocurrency would have the chance to overinflate the currency and would then tank its value, as more of that currency would exist. Another ethical question arises with privacy. With AI technology listening to our voice, companies could record our audio and sell it to the highest bidder. AI could also use the chat logs that you generate with the AI for data. The metaverse is a very expansive universe, but if not used properly, it could lead to the metaverse being use for a destructive force.
