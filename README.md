#Watson x scedule displayer bot 

This bot is trained to display any scedule that is given to it, while knowing the time and day. note the this version is displaying my school scedule but with some effort, you can make it display your scedule. 



#Process of making the bot:

1. I first made the action by pressing new action in the action tab.
2. I then added a step to verfiy the user's classes.
3. Then i counted the amount of periods that i had in a day and added each period as a step.
4.  then i put each period into the robot
5. then i put the spefic day and time for each period
6. ironed out some  bugs after doing that
7. and finaly implemented user testing.


#learnings:


some of the learnings that i found through the process of making this bot are intresting to say the least, and they are:

*you cannot import datasets or the bot to train on, you will have to manuly have to hard code them into the actions.

*always look at the oeder of your actions, as it will detrmin the flow of the bot.

*for coustom messages, either go to the preview tab and select the seconnd option or the third tab to disable the hme scereen, and then got to action and set by assistant and then got to greet coustoumer and the the discription of that action to your welcom message.

*at most only have one action in your bot.
