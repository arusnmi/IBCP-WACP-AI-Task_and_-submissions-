#Watson x scedule displayer bot 

THis bot's creation was to fulfil the goal of displaying the DP! scedule accruactly with acording to tome and day to sucessfuly help DOP students not get lost and th not find their class. 



#Process of making the bot:



1. Created the Action by Pressing "New Action" in the Action Tab

* What You Did: You started by creating a new action, which is the foundation for the task or process you want to automate. This is typically done in a development or automation platform where actions are the building blocks for workflows.

*Why It’s Important: Creating an action is the first step in automating a process. It allows you to define a specific task or series of tasks that the system will execute. This initial setup is crucial because it determines the scope and purpose of the automation.

2. Added a Step to Verify the User's Classes

*What You Did: After creating the action, you added a step to verify the user's classes. This could involve checking the user's schedule, confirming class registration, or validating that the user is enrolled in the correct classes.

*Why It’s Important: Verifying the user's classes ensures that the subsequent steps are based on accurate and relevant information. This step helps prevent errors and ensures that the action performs as intended, tailored to the user's actual schedule.

3. Counted the Number of Periods in a Day and Added Each Period as a Step

*What You Did: You counted how many periods (or class sessions) occur in a single day and then added a corresponding step for each period in your action.

*Why It’s Important: By counting the periods, you’re breaking down the user's day into manageable parts. Adding a step for each period allows the action to handle each time slot individually, ensuring that the bot or system knows what needs to happen during each period.

4. Input Each Period into the Bot

*What You Did: You manually entered information about each period into the bot. This likely included details such as the class name, teacher, subject, or any specific tasks associated with that period.

*Why It’s Important: Inputting period data into the bot equips it with the necessary information to function correctly. This step is critical for making the bot aware of the user’s schedule, allowing it to provide relevant reminders, notifications, or actions based on the user’s daily routine.

5. Specified the Day and Time for Each Period

*What You Did: After inputting the period details, you specified the exact day and time for each period. This means you mapped each class or activity to its specific time slot in the user's weekly schedule.

*Why It’s Important: Specifying the day and time is essential for timing the action correctly. It ensures that the bot or automation performs tasks at the right moments, such as sending reminders just before a class starts or logging activities at the appropriate time.

6. Ironed Out Bugs

*What You Did: After setting up the action, you encountered and resolved some bugs. Bugs are common when developing new features, and they can range from simple errors (like incorrect data input) to more complex issues (like logic flaws in the action).

*Why It’s Important: Debugging is a crucial part of the development process. Fixing bugs ensures that the action runs smoothly and as expected, reducing the likelihood of errors when the action is used by real users.

7. Implemented User Testing

*What You Did: Finally, you conducted user testing to validate the action. This involved having actual users interact with the action to see how it performs in real-world scenarios.

*Why It’s Important: User testing is vital for identifying issues that may not be apparent during development. It allows you to gather feedback, observe how users interact with the action, and make any necessary adjustments before full deployment. This step helps ensure that the action is user-friendly, reliable, and meets the users' needs.

#learnings:


Some of the learnings I discovered during the process of making this bot are interesting, to say the least, and they include:

* You cannot import datasets for the bot to train on; you will have to manually hard code them into the actions.
* Always pay attention to the order of your actions, as it will determine the flow of the bot.
* For custom messages, either go to the Preview tab and select the second option, or go to the third tab to disable the home screen. Then, go to Action, set   it by Assistant, and go to Greet Customer. Finally, change the description of that action to your welcome message.
* It’s best to have only one action in your bot at most.

I struggled to get the bot to even show the welcome message, as it was my very first time using this software. Due to that, it took me a considerable amount of time to manage the bot, but I eventually finished it.
