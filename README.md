# watson-x-scedule-bot-
Objective: to help next students to manage their time table in school
Functionality: to show the current session based on the date and the time 


The first part of my journey starts with my flow chart skills. I had never known what a flowchart was but then after some sessions that I had with my sir, I understood that it was used to plan out any process that is made. 

Then i started making flowcharts regarding different topics, such as the turing test, my journey to school, and to map out existing AI

This is the first flow chart i had created, it was to map out the functions of the eliza chatbot:


This is the current one i used to make my bot:

Then I started with using watson x, and i found it to be a very bad tool to use because of the lack of customisation, and the fact that it is not user friendly. The first time I made a bot, I lost all my progress because I launched a second instance of it, removing my entire save progress of that bot. 
I then started mastering watson x after i used it for over a week , but i made some decent progress on the bot and even did some bug fixes to it, and it finally works as intended. The way it works is that in the first message from the user, it tries to detect certain words in some phrases that i pre coded into the bot, such as “i want my period” or “ i need my schedule” and then it prompts the user to verify their class( note, i have only done DP1s schedule, otherwise i would not have finished the project), then it detects the day and the current time and based on the current time, it will display the period. The learnings that i gained from the experience is to always save your work, and how to work the ins and outs of watson x to make more bots with the program. 
For further explanation of the above, here is the video(it also shows the chat bot working, and shows proof of creation): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m5--l1xDFYJwfcB1eQ8Any7CRyMPcSVo/view?usp=sharing
