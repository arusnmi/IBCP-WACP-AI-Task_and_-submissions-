Data Collection Process

The process of collecting data for this model was a strenuous one. The reason for it being so challenging is that I wanted to use images that were within the rights of CC0.

CC0 refers to a license that allows me to freely use images without needing to give credit.

Initially, it was very hard to find CC0 images, as there are not many readily available. However, after stumbling upon a few images from one site, I realized I had found a good source for CC0 images.

The website, called PxHere, is a platform where CC0 images can be found, and that is what I used for my project.


Use of gooogle teachable 

teachable machine was a good help for creating the model, it helped me by orignasing the files i put in for the model, and made it very quick to access the model. 



Overall Reflection of the Model

The model did not perform to the requirements I had expected. Its functionality was very simplistic, as it could only capture images that were clear.

Out of the 22 test images I provided, it only classified 4 correctly. The test images used to evaluate the model were intentionally difficult to interpret, and I had hoped it would perform better, but it did not.

Overall, the model was a failure.
